# canary
Caretaker app created at Wellesley-Simmons hackathon


Inspiration

A few of our team members understand the difficulties that disabled family members face, and have sought out technological solutions for monitoring their well-being. However, most of the software available is expensive, inaccurate, or doesn't suit the individual needs of the client. Therefore, we created Canary as a simple way to compare lifestyle choices and behavior, sleep, and mood. This allows parents and caretakers to come to their own conclusions, rather than relying on incomplete and irrelevant generated data.

How it works

This app allows the user to input food intake, medicine intake, sleep, activity, behavior and mood changes. They are prompted to enter information into certain categories (for instance: food groups, activity type, medicine dosage, etc.) along with a time or a time range. This data populates into a calendar, where the user has access to each entry along with notes, and each entry "type" (food, behavior, sleep, etc.) is color coded. Therefore, the user can find correlations between certain elements, such as sleep and behavior, or activity and mood.
